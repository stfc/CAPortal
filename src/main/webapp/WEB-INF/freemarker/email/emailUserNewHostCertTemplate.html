        Dear ${clientCN??},<br/>
        Thank you for requesting a new host certificate from the UK e-Science CA.<br/> 
        The requested host certificate DNs is:<br/> 
        [${requestedDN??}]<br/>
        <br/>
        Now please contact one of your Registration Authority operators confirming that 
        you submitted the request. The RA will then approve the request(s). 
        Please remember PIN that you just used.  The RA will ask you for it.  It is to prove that *you* made the request.
        <br/>
        <br>
        Your Registration Authority operator(s) are:<br/> 
        ${raCNs>>}<br/>
        <br/>
        And their last known email addresses:<br/>
        ${raEmails??}<br/>
        Please contact the CA if these RAs are unavailable.<br/> 
        Yours faithfully,<br/>
        CA Operator 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Please note: After your certificate request has been approved, 
        if you get an authentication error when trying to access the portal 
        then the chances are you may have a certificate from our CA that has now <b>expired</b>. 
        To get round this you'll likely have to restart your browser and/or clear your Recent History
        and this time press 'Cancel' if prompted to select your (expired) certificate.
